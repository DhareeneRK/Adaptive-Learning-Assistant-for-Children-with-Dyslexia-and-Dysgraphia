## Adaptive Learning Assistant for Children with Dyslexia and Dysgraphia
The Adaptive Learning Assistant is an AI-powered web platform designed to support children with dyslexia (reading disability) and dysgraphia (writing disability). It delivers personalized learning using machine learning, multi-sensory activities, speech technologies, and accessibility-focused UI to improve reading and writing outcomes.

## About the Project
Children affected by learning disabilities often struggle with traditional learning systems due to non-personalized content, limited accessibility features, and lack of progress visibility. This project provides a real-time adaptive platform that:

Adjusts learning difficulty using machine learning

Supports reading using TTS and dyslexia-friendly formatting

Enhances writing using speech-to-text, handwriting analysis, and word prediction

Tracks student progress with analytics for parents and teachers

The platform follows WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards and ensures COPPA & GDPR compliant data security.
